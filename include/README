READ ME Simple Cooling Control System


This program is designed to run a simple 3-6V motor (with a fan) depending on light exposure and temperature exposure, it also sends readings and output states out the serial port as a JSON file.



THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED FOR AN ARDUINO UNO
THIS PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON TWO LIBRARIES
Adafruit’s DHT sensor library (version 1.4.6)
Bblanchon’s ArduinoJson library (version 7.4.2)



All hardware is defined by name and digital IO port, underneath that all aliases are defined
Setup is self-explanatory

Then void loop executes the logic below:
•	If the photoresistor sees dark:
    o	When temp is below 68 Green light is on
    o	When temp is between 68 and 69 Red light is on and motor is on a lower setting (100/255)
    o	When the temp is between 69 and 71 Red light is on and motor is on a medium setting (200/255)
    o	When the temp is over 71 Red light is on and motor is on a high setting (255/255)
•	If the photoresistor sees light:
    o	When temp is below 72 Green light is on
    o	When temp is between 72 and 73 Red light is on and motor is on a lower setting (100/255)
    o	When the temp is between 73 and 75 Red light is on and motor is on a medium setting (200/255)
    o	When the temp is over 75 Red light is on and motor is on a high setting (255/255)
•	The DeviceID, Light Level, Temperature, Humidity, Fan Status, and Fan Setting are sent to a JSON document, which is pushed out of the Serial   Port 9600
